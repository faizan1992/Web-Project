# Web-Project, 
I am currently working on a project and have attached the coding file for your refrence. If I talk about my strategy, I designed it in such a way that it is platform r4esponsive. which means you can run it on tablet, Mobile or in any device, it will be responsive. I have done clean coding. The names of ID and CLASSES predicts exactly what they work.
